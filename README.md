# PlistEDPlus - open source cross-platform lightweight Plist file editor

Write in front: The prototype of this software is from: https://github.com/alpex92/PlistED , thanks to this prototype, not to let me start coding from zero, thanks to @alpex92!

When writing this software, actually some hesitation, similar software seems to be quite a lot, plus the relationship of time, has not paid substantial action. But the idea of writing a Plist editor has been lingering, so it finally led to PlistEDPlus...

## New: Add aml, kext, efi files for OpenCore. The operation is very simple, take ACPI as an example: select Add under ACPI, drag and drop one or more aml files to the app window.

## Features include but are not limited to.
