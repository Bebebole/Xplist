# PlistEDPlus-- open source cross-platform lightweight Plist file editor

Written in front: The prototype of this software comes from https://github.com/alpex92/PlistED. Because of the existence of this prototype, it won't make me code bricks from scratch. Thanks @alpex92!

When I wrote this software, I actually hesitated, and there seemed to be quite a few similar softwares. In addition, due to the time, I never took any substantial action. But the idea of writing a Plist editor has been lingering, so it finally led to PlistEDPlus ...

## Features include but are not limited to:

* Simple and easy-to-use man-machine interaction, with refined functions, no bloated and unnecessary

* open source, cross-platform (currently supports win, mac, linux)

* humanized search function (a. search the keyboard initials of each column of keys, data types and values within the expanded nodes; B. Search box global search, display search results at one time)

* fully comply with and comply with plist file technical specifications, and the data type display is completely consistent with plist text without any escape

* Multi-tab browsing documents

* Multilingual support (currently supports Chinese, Russian and English)

* drag and drop the file to the software interface to open the file, double-click to open the file, display the history of file opening, and automatically load the last opened file

* add, remove, paste, cut, edit entries, etc., all of which are included in the Undo and Redo policy groups, and support revocation and recovery

* expand and collapse the right-click menu of items, which has different effects in different columns

* for the value of data type, the floating window automatically displays the corresponding ASCII and Base64 values

* When the data type is changed, its value will be automatically converted.

* you can freely choose the children under a node to sort by A->Z (the array is not sorted at present)

* Built-in update check

* If the currently opened file is modified by other programs, it will automatically prompt whether to reload it.

* Software UI adapts to various resolutions and supports winpe, linux livecd, etc.
